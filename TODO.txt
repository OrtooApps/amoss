Amoss - Apex Mocks, Spies and Stubs

Documentation:

    Full interface definition?
    Consider a class diagram for developers?
    Language syntax diagram?

    2 Sobjects with the same properties are regarded as being the same objects
    2 Objects with the same properties are NOT regarded as being the same objects


Implement

    Could recognise when objects are a different instance before failing in order to give a better assertion failure message

    Document what is included in the installation.

    Code documentation (search for TODOs)

    Move all string contatonation over to string.format, and move ' over to " where used in a string

    Test:

        Consider adding a lot more tests - check what doesn't fail when you comment things out

        look if there are more 'expects' behaviours to test with named parameters
        do we need to test 'allows' behaviours with named parameters
        withParameters, using a List
        withParameters, using a Map
        callDescription changes based on the type of parameter matching

    Test:

        Test the behaviour of combinations, with regards to 'allowsAnyCall'

            Define a when, then expects, call a method that is not defined, fails the test
            Define a when, then allows,  call a method that is not defined, fails the test
            Define an expects, then when, call a method that is not defined, fails the test
            Define an allows, then when, call a method that is not defined, fails the test
            Define an expects, then allows, call a method that is not defined, fails the test
            Define an allows, then expects, call a method that is not defined, fails the test

        When and allows matches before Expected

        Setting 'returning' when the method has a void return
            methodUnderDoubleWithNoReturn - when setup to return something

        Not setting 'returning' when the method has a non void return
            methodUnderDouble - when setup not to return anything
 
        Test expects with List, Set, Map - test assertions with the same - is List<Object> an Object?
        Test returns List, Set, Map

    General:

        What happens with methods that are not supposed to return something?
            Looks like it works, just need to write tests to prove it

    Mock:

        How to pass an 'expects parameter' when we're passing sObjects?

    Spy:

        Currently supports
            mockThing.countOf( 'method' )
        why not 
            mockThing.get().countOf( 'method' )
            this would be in line with the parameter getters
