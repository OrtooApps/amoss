Amoss - Apex Mocks, Spies and Stubs

Documentation:

    Document the differences between the matching for:
        Primitives
        Objects - implementing 'equals'
        Sobjects

        setTo / setToEqual

    Full interface definition?
    Consider a class diagram for developers?
    Language syntax diagram?

Implement

    Test:
        !!!!! Named parameter when more parameters are set than are possible to be passed
            Potentially the wrong overloaded method was called

        Only need to test exhaustively with positional expects
        Then add a simple test for named 

        * withFieldsSetLike( Sobject )

        * withFieldsSetTo( Map<String,Object> )
            * All fields match - matches
            * Passed has more fields, but all specified fields match - matches
            * Not all fields match - no match
            * Not all fields populated - no match
            * Null - no match
            * Invalid field specified in map - no match

        What happens with List / Map / Set?

    Look at removing duplication between:
        * Amoss_PositionalParameterValueDefiner
        * Amoss_NamedParameterValueDefiner

    Test overloaded behaviour that results in: "was called with an unexpected number of parameters"

    Have a look:
        Can you implement Amoss_ExpectationObjectParameter - do you need to?

    Consider
        Just have a look - how would the new syntax drop into this?

    Move all string contatonation over to string.format, and move ' over to " where used in a string?

    Test:

        Consider adding a lot more tests - check what doesn't fail when you comment things out

        look if there are more 'expects' behaviours to test with named parameters
        do we need to test 'allows' behaviours with named parameters
        withParameters, using a List
        withParameters, using a Map
        callDescription changes based on the type of parameter matching

    Test:

        Test the behaviour of combinations, with regards to 'allowsAnyCall'

            Define a when, then expects, call a method that is not defined, fails the test
            Define a when, then allows,  call a method that is not defined, fails the test
            Define an expects, then when, call a method that is not defined, fails the test
            Define an allows, then when, call a method that is not defined, fails the test
            Define an expects, then allows, call a method that is not defined, fails the test
            Define an allows, then expects, call a method that is not defined, fails the test

        When and allows matches before Expected

        Setting 'returning' when the method has a void return
            methodUnderDoubleWithNoReturn - when setup to return something

        Not setting 'returning' when the method has a non void return
            methodUnderDouble - when setup not to return anything
 
        Test expects with List, Set, Map - test assertions with the same - is List<Object> an Object?
        Test returns List, Set, Map

    General:
        What happens with methods that are not supposed to return something?
            Looks like it works, just need to write tests to prove it

    Spy:
        Currently supports
            mockThing.countOf( 'method' )
        why not 
            mockThing.get().countOf( 'method' )
            this would be in line with the parameter getters
