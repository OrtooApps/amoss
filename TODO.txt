Amoss - Apex Mocks, Spies and Stubs

Documentation:

    Write a packager:
        * Copy the current force-app into a temp directory
        * Remove amoss_examples
        * Call the packager



    Full interface definition?
    Consider a class diagram for developers?
    Language syntax diagram?

    Implement:
        Look for duplication in the grammar specification
        Compilation test for all the combinations that are allowed in the grammar?

    Document:
        class documentation for Amoss_MethodHandler would be nice - see Amoss_ValueVerifier

    Consider reducing:
        setToTheSameValueAs to setToSameValueAs

    Think about withElements
        setTo (given a list)
        what else would you implement?

    Look at removing duplication between:
        * Amoss_ExpectationFieldsSetToParameter
        * Amoss_ExpectationFieldsSetLikeParameter

    Consider
        Just have a look - how would the new syntax drop into this?

    Move all string contatonation over to string.format, and move ' over to " where used in a string?

    Test:

        Setting 'returning' when the method has a void return
            methodUnderDoubleWithNoReturn - when setup to return something

    Spy:
        Currently supports
            mockThing.countOf( 'method' )
        why not
            mockThing.get().countOf( 'method' )
            this would be in line with the parameter getters
